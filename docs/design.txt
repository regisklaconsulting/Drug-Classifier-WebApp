====================
Web App Design 
====================

1. Introduction
===============

Here we describe the main design decisions regarding a small web app to expose the drug classifier model. 

2. Functional Design
====================

The web app has the following features: 

- a loading function for the scikit-learn pipeline and the model. 
- a function to predict drug labels based on user input. 
- an input UI using Gradio sliders for float values and Gradio radio for categorical values.

We will provide all of these variables and the prediction function to the Gradio Interface function and launch it.
To make our web app look modern, we will use a default soft theme.

3. Technical Design
===================

The full stack dev will directly craft the app/drug_app.py script. 

def predict_drug(age, sex, blood_pressure, cholesterol, na_to_k_ratio):
- TODO 







Confer to the script code for the details.
